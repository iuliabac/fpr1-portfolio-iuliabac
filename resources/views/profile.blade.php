    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>I am from Romania and was born in Bucharest, the capital city, on 10th of March. </p>
    <p>For as long as I can remember, I have been obsessed with computers. Both of my parents, spent a logt of time on the computer and I wanted to try it out. I would play games on it, surf the web, and even fix and analyze data and folders at a very young age, that most people couldent solve at my age.</p>
    <p>My favourite subject during school was IT and had it for every year (Y1-Y12). I would always finnish my assignments ahead of the others and would play web games and even help my other colleges that were stuck!</p>
    <p>I am a very organized individual when it comes to data. Most of my projects involve using Excel or Sheets. These projects include collections of various interests that I have, such as music and videos. Each one is categorized by country of origin, creator, and year, with the title added next to it. </p>

    <h2>My Goal</h2>
    <p>I came here for one goal, and my goal in the future is to become and suceed as a data manager. My parents and my friends have seen me throught my live as one and everybody thinks that I cand partake this so called "challenge", and I am sure that I can accomplish it. </p>

    <h2>My interests</h2>
    <p>some of my other interests, besides computing include geography, (I went to competitions back in middle school) anything revolving collecting (CDs, movies, trinkets, cards, etc.) and travelling (every saturday, I hop on a train and see where it will take me). </p>
    <p>My family would always tell me that I am a walking "Wikipedia", telling fun facts that interest me as well as their interests.</p>
    <p>FUN FACT! I speak Romanian, English, French, Italian and now learning Dutch.</p>
